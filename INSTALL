Locating the software

repository.

Official milestone releases can be found here :

-----------------------
Source Release Packages
-----------------------

Download the latest release tarball/zip file and extract it to a temporary
location or check out the source from the code hosting site into a local
working copy directory.

Run the setup file in the root directory like this::

    python setup.py install

This automatically places the required files in the ``lib/site-packages``
directory of the Python version you used to run the setup script, may be
part of a virtualenv or similar.

-----------
Python Eggs
-----------

You can build and install eggs with aws-auth-helper using the ``setup_egg.py``
file provided in the source distribution.

All the usual commands are supported e.g.::

    python setup_egg.py develop
    python setup_egg.py bdist_egg
    ...

This requires that you install distribute or setuptools which is not part of
the Python standard library.

See the following URL for details :-

    - ``distribute`` - http://guide.python-distribute.org/

    - ``setuptools`` (old) - http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools

.. warning:: ``setuptools`` is now very long in the tooth and full of bugs! \
    Just use distribute, or pip instead.

Download and install the latest easy_install script and run the following
command ::

    easy_install aws-auth-helper

This will go to the Python Package Index and automatically find the 
appropriate version of aws-auth-helper for your Python setup.

Alternatively, you can use pip instead of easy_install.

Just download the latest version of pip from PyPI found here -
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip and run the following command ::

    pip install aws-auth-helper
